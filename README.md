## Stack

- React
- Redux
- Redux Toolkit
- React Router
- Material UI
- React testing Library


## State Management 

Client side state management vs Server side state Management

Since we have data provided one time. It's better to use client side state management,

Redux tool kit provides easy abstraction over react redux to create reducers, actions etc. so it would be easy choice here.

## Things to Improve

- We can add more tests. I would have added/improved test coverage more.
- Add Virtualization/ Pagination for the grid.
- We can add limitless features and code improvisations here.
